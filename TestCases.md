## üìå System Launch Overview

* Our open-source **problem retrieval platform** was launched on **May 21, 2025**: http://1.94.255.218:5000/
* In less than a week, the platform has recorded nearly **2,000 search queries**.
* The blog post introducing the system on **Codeforces** has received over **250 upvotes** and positive community feedback: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/143098
* **Use cases** include:

  * **Similar Problem Retrieval**: Assisting contestants in expanding their problem-solving perspective and addressing knowledge blind spots.
  * **Duplicate Problem Retrieval**: Helping problem setters identify previously seen ideas or solutions early on.

## üß™ Test Case 1: Duplicate Retrieval in a Recent Contest

**Target Contest**

* **Name**: The 2025 CCPC National Invitational Contest (Northeast), The 19th Northeast Collegiate Programming Contest
* **Url**: https://codeforces.com/gym/105924
* **Date**: May 25, 2025
* **Total Problems**: 12

**Key Findings**

* The system successfully identified **6 problems** with highly similar or identical historical counterparts.
* Only the **top 3 results per query** were manually inspected, indicating a **duplicate rate of at least 50%**‚Äîlikely higher in practice.
* Under current scoring rules, solving these 6 problems is enough to secure a **silver medal**, and just one additional easy problem would result in a **gold medal**, raising **serious fairness concerns**.

## üß™ Test Case 2: Similar Problem Retrieval ‚Äì MEX Variants

We conducted a query with the classic problem "**interval MEX**" to identify its **variants across different contests**, aiming to showcase the system‚Äôs utility for **idea expansion and knowledge transfer**.

### Query Problem Description

> Given a sequence of $n$ natural numbers $a[1..n]$, answer $m$ queries.
> Each query specifies a range $[l, r]$, and asks for $\mathrm{mex}({a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r})$ ‚Äî
> the **minimum excluded value** in the subarray.
>
> This problem can be solved in **$O((n + m) log n)$** time using segment trees.
